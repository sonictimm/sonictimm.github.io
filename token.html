<p>Gunters, <br />
Congratulations on clearing the first gate.  <br />Unlike in the book, it doesn't require a key.  You made it.  Pat yourself on the back.  Princess Justine, give us a curtsey.  
But your quest is far from over.  <br /><br />
If you hit that target with your bow, you must have sharp eyes.  But how sharp are your wits when you've lost your sight? <br />
The next quest will take you on an eight pixel adventure.  Anyone who has played the game is not allowed to speak. <br />
One player will be blindfolded, and the others will direct that player through the game to the next clue.<br />
Oh, and if you find the easter egg, you'll get a hint that can be used at any point during the day.  Who knows, it might even come in handy when you're cornered somewhere.</p>
